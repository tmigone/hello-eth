# hello-eth

Simple "Hello, world!" like ethereum related experiments. 


## Contents

__Note__: Projects in this repo are mostly for learning and experimentation, you probably won't see tests, errors being catched, or production ready code, just whatever is needed for me to test the library/tool/etc at hand.

Content is organized in the following way:
- contracts --> noteworthy solidity experiments, tutorials, etc
- dapps --> webapps that interact with the ethereum blockchain in some way
- scripts --> random scripts

### Dapps
